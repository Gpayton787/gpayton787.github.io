Hi I'm Greg! I'm a senior at UCLA studying computer science. My interests are in the software engineering principles that allow for complex systems to arise. Software is like a giant, living piece of art with thousands of different components created by potentially, thousands of different artists, at different times. But unlike art, it serves a practical purpose and it actually has to work. For this to happen, proper rules and interfaces have to be set, documentation has to be written, tools have to be picked, and the list goes on. Important principles and abstractions, developed only in the last few decades, underpin all the software we see today and they are constantly evolving, making this field incredibly fascinating. Upon graduation in 2026, I plan to work in industry as a software engineer, creating high-quality software that produces value for someone, whoever it may be.

**More about me** 

I was born and raised in the great state of Oklahoma. Moving around quite often, I currently reside among the rainy fir trees in Washington state. In my free time, I like to keep myself moving with various activities such as basketball, running, or working out. These things keep me sane after sitting for too long and are always better with a friend. I also love to explore new places. Whether it's new restaraunts, hiking trails, or study spots, my apartment is the last place I want to be when there's so much out there just waiting for me! This curiosity of the unknown drives me to keep pushing my own boundaries and continue learning more about myself and the world, each and every day.
