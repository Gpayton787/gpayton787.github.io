It actually wasn’t too bad but I still prefer Japanese.</p> <p>This movie was LONG and action PACKED. It was like multiple movies in one or 6 separate episodes smushed together. At one point there was a calm flash back scene that was disconnected from the chaos I actually started to doze off. I was beginning to think the movie would be over soon. But nope, right back into the action. There were three main fights with the last one being as epic as a conclusion as you could ask for in a movie.</p> <p>Overall, there are concerns about the pacing but it makes sense. At one point in a battle inside the demon castle are you going to have time to rest.</p> <p>That being said the rest of the movie was amazing. The fights were astonishing and very well animated and the music was fantastic too.</p> <p>If you haven’t wathced it in theaters you’re missing out!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My thoughts on the first movie of the trilogy.]]></summary></entry></feed>
