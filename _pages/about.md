Hi I'm Greg! I'm a senior at UCLA studying computer science. My interests are in software engineering principles that allow for complex systems to arise: object oriented programming, proper API design, scalability, and well-written documentation. These things are critical as you start to increase the number of uniquely-minded engineers working together. I also have an keen interest in computer architecture design for more efficient CPUs, GPUs, or custom ASICs.

Some more about me. I was born and raised in the great state of Oklahoma. Moving around quite often, I currently reside among the rainy fir trees in Washington state (with my parents, for now).

In my free time, I stay moving with various activities such as basketball, running, or working out. I also really love to explore new places. Had I lived during the [Age of Exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery), I surely would've captained my own ship.
