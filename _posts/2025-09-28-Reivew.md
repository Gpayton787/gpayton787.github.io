# Final Verdict: 9/10

First off I watched it in dub, as that was the only way to convince my sister to go. It actually wasn't too bad but I still prefer Japanese.

This movie was LONG and action PACKED. It was like multiple movies in one or 6 separate episodes smushed together. At one point there was a calm flash back scene that was so disconnected from the chaos I actually started to doze off. I was beginning to think the movie would be over soon. But nope, right back into the action. There were three main fights with the last one being as epic as a conclusion you could ask for in a movie.

Overall, there are concerns about the pacing but it makes sense. At what point in a battle inside the demon castle are you going to have time to rest. That being said, the movie was amazing. The fights were astonishing and very well animated and the music was fantastic too. 

If you haven't wathced it in theaters you're missing out!
