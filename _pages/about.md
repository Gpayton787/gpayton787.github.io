Hi I’m Greg! I’m a senior at UCLA studying computer science. If there's one thing this degree has taught me, it's how to approach complex problems in simple way. Upon graduation, I plan to become a professional software engineer, contributing my passion and experience to projects that will change lives for the better.

**More about me** 

I was born and raised in the great state of Oklahoma. Moving around quite often, I currently reside in Washington state, and go to school in California. In my free time, I like to keep myself moving by playing basketball, running, or working out. I also love to explore new places whether it's restaurants, study spots, or hikes. Curiosity of the unknown drives me to keep pushing my own boundaries and continue learning more about myself and the world, each and every day... well, most days.
