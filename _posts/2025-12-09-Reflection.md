A few hours ago I took my last final of the quarter. Now, I lay on the grassy hill near Janss Steps, under a shaded tree, and warmed by both the outside air and the green, hooded, sweater that I've worn for the third day in a row. Before the high tide recedes and carries with it everything that has happened in the past ten weeks, it is important to reflect and make sense of it all. This post serves a public reflection of the things I've learned and stories I'd like to share that are hopefully interesting, and worth the time of you, the reader.

### Finding New Friends

Even in your senior year of college, it's not too late to make life-long friends. Over the last three years, I was regrettably more isolated than I wanted to be, and I wish I had made the effort to find and maintain more friendships. This is especially true about friends in my major. Having close friends on the same career path is very important as it keeps you in check, motivated, and makes sure you never fall behind. Most importantly, having friends to talk to who are in the same position as you, keeps you grounded when the stress, anxiety, and negative thoughts try to sweep you off your feet.

Some people may naturally graviate towards others when things get turbulent. And others naturally become more isolated. I was the latter, and it takes a concious effort to resist that tendency. It is almost always better to find solace with others.

So if there is one takeaway I have for this quarter it's to always be on the lookout for new friends. Don't close yourself off and try to learn and grow that way. Expose yourself to many different types of people and reduce some of the friction in your life by letting others in.

### Getting Away From it all

Have you ever felt the need to just run away from it all? Well this is your sign to just do it. I'm not saying to run away from your all problems... at least not forever. But I am saying that when you start to feel boxed in, it's important to recognize that and take some sort of action.

For example, whenever I have a stressful week at work or at school, I don't just want to go back to my gloomy apartment whose only windows face out to a concrete courtyard. My social battery is also probably drained so maybe I don't want to hang out with friends either. Instead I crave to get outside of it all; Outside the walls that make up the boundary of my daily life. So what do I do? I just start running. Not mindlessly, but to a certain destination. I'll pick a park that I want to visit, a beach with a beautiful sunset, and perhaps a pastry shop along the way to refuel and get some water. Whatever adventure I plan out beforehand, the main idea is that I'll spend all day on my feet, exploring new places, and leaving behind my life as I know it for a time. And for this time all that matters is sunning loosely to my destination.

Once I finally decide to go home, I'm absolutely exhausted, but mentally complacent. I'm now ready and eager to back to my normal life in all it's glory.

So, next time you're feeling trapped, choose some place as your destinaton, and your mini journey before the sun gets to high in the sky.

### Consistency and Prolonged Effort Rules it all

This is probably a very obvious principle, yet it can't be stressed enough. In almost everything you do, you want to start early, and work on it day by day, over a long period of time. Miracles don't happen because you spent the last 24 hours preparing for some big thing that you really want. They happen when you have the foresight to know what you want and be consistent in your effort in to achieving it.

### The Importance of Documentation

This quarter I recognized that documentation is a very important thing to me. Without it, things that happen, happen, and then they stay in our not-so-persistent memories. So once I leave UCLA for good, I'll see my friends less and less, my memories of the good times will start to fade. If I don't document things in the moment, time will eventually erode them.

There are many other great reasons to document important things in your life. An obvious one, is that you can share things with other people. Telling stories by mouth is great, but what happens when you start to forget to things? How many people can possibly tell one by one?

This quarter, I made an effort to start documenting things about my life. Things worth documenting might be things that I watch or books that I read, to help increase the worth and connection to the content I'm consuming. It also might be trips or fun moments with friends, that you'll look back on and treasure. All those involved will thank you for your efforts in preserving those moments.

So don't be afraid to hit record and start typing up a blog post to make things in your life that much more concrete and meaningful. The hardest part however is finding time to actually edit your recorded videos or find time to write your documentaion. It is by no means easy but I've deteremined that the effort put into it is more worth it in the long run than most other things.
