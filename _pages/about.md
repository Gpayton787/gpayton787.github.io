Hi I'm Greg! I'm a senior at UCLA studying computer science. My interests lie in building and scaling robust distributed systems and writing clean, maintainable code. Upon graduation, I plan to work in industry, applying and developing my skills to help build software or hardware solutions.

In my free time, I like to keep myself moving with Calisthenics and Running. One of my favorite things to do when bored is to run around the city to whatever cool spots I can find. Often times it'll be a park where I can practice muscle ups, handstands, and work on progressing to a front lever. I also really love cooking for my friends and family. My speciality is [Moussaka](https://www.google.com/search?q=moussaka+&sca_esv=2bd7f66af8684dc4&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS934US934&sxsrf=AE3TifOP3U4ZfQY1Qp1gARsoLVZxiRP-3w%3A1759099700988&ei=NLvZaKaPPMnykPIPr47gAQ&ved=0ahUKEwim-bSGxfyPAxVJOUQIHS8HOAAQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=moussaka+&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCW1vdXNzYWthIDIKECMYgAQYJxiKBTIKECMYgAQYJxiKBTIQEC4YgAQYsQMYQxiDARiKBTIIEAAYgAQYyQMyCxAAGIAEGJIDGIoFMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgARI4ARQZVhlcAF4AZABAJgBP6ABP6oBATG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgKgAkfCAgcQIxiwAxgnwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR5gDAIgGAZAGCZIHATKgB8QOsgcBMbgHQ8IHAzAuMsgHBQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) which I can make vegan or non-vegan depending on the guests.
