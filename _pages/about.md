Hi I'm Greg! I'm a senior at UCLA studying computer science. My favorite topic in computer science is object-oriented programming as it naturally breaks up large and complex systems into self contained objects, making them much easier to understand and expand.

Upon graduation, I plan to work in industry, applying and developing my skills to help build software or hardware solutions. I'm also interested in life sciences and will be concurrently pursuing a full-time job and later, a career in dentistry, as I finish up my undergrad.

If I had to describe myself with one attribute it would be family-oriented. Nothing beats a bunch of snacks and a movie night with the fam!

In my free time, I like to keep myself moving with Calisthenics and Running. When I lived in Seattle in the Summer of 2025, my favorite thing to do was run around the city to whatever cool spots I could find. Often times, this would be to a park where I can practice muscle ups, handstands, and work on progressing to a front lever. I also really love cooking.
