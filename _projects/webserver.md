**In the capstone of UCLA's Computer Science degree, after three years of rigorous training...** we are tasked with one last project to prove our readiness to enter the wider world: a C++ web server. While not particularly exciting, it's basic enough to provide isolated practice with certain principles, and complex enough to emulate what working on real industry software would be like. Split into groups of four, and mentored by three Google engineers, each team works their way to the finish line. How well will they understand and apply software engineering principles? How well will they work together? What critical decisions will they make at each fork in the road? Their fate will be determined wholly by themselves.

## How it went

I joined a team of three that would end up becoming some of my best friends. We named our team "degenerative-ai" and we got to work on buildling our web server and meeting every week. Each week we rotated the position of tech lead, updated our documentation, built out new features, and added unit and integration tests. This was as close as I'd ever been to the actual software development process in industry and it was very efficient and sustainable. In the end completed our web server on time and build a web application on top of our web server for our final project. My teammate Ryan Tang won an award for "Most lines of code commited" and I won an award for "Most comments given as TL". Overall, this was my favorite class I've ever taken at UCLA and I learned so much from the experience of the lecturers and my own experience with my team.

## What I learned


### 👨‍💻 Acting as TL: The Art of Code Review

I loved being the TL. 

### 📝 Documentaiton and Extensibility

Documentation is so important. Sometimes the person whose going to read it, is you 9 months later. 

### 🙂 Everything has an Interface

Everything interacts with each other through interfaces. How they're defined is incredibly important.

### ⏱️ How To Save Your Precious Time: Attention to Detail and Proper Testing

Early on, a few Subtleties would ultimately lead to lots of debugging later on down the line. 

These would have been caught with proper integration testing. 
1) Test large request
2) Test large image response

### How We Used AI and How We Will Continue to Use it

Very useful. But none of could have been replaced. Drop a single one of
